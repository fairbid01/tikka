/**
 * GeoMiddleware — resolves the client's country from their IP address
 * and attaches it as the `x-country-code` request header.
 *
 * This middleware performs geo-location only (country detection) and does NOT
 * block requests. For geo-blocking functionality, use GeoBlockingMiddleware.
 *
 * Expected headers for country detection:
 *   - CF-IPCountry: Country code from Cloudflare (checked first)
 *   - X-Country-Code: Fallback country code header
 *   - If neither header is present, resolves country from client IP using GeoService
 *
 * Downstream handlers (guards, services) can read:
 *   request.headers['x-country-code']  →  e.g. "US", "NG", "GB", or "" for unknown
 *
 * The header is set to an empty string when geo lookup fails or the IP
 * is private, so consumers must always handle the empty-string case.
 *
 * Environment configuration:
 *   - GEO_PROVIDER_URL: URL for IP geolocation service (defaults to ip-api.com)
 *   - GEO_TIMEOUT_MS: Timeout for geolocation requests (defaults to 3000ms)
 *
 * Registration: applied globally in AppModule via configure(consumer).
 * Should be applied BEFORE GeoBlockingMiddleware if both are used.
