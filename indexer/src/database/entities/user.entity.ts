/**
 * Aggregated per-user participation statistics.
 * Keyed by Stellar address (natural PK — no auto-increment needed).
 * Updated upsert-style whenever a TicketPurchased or RaffleFinalized event
 * is processed for this address.
 *
 * Columns map to the `users` table in ARCHITECTURE.md.
 *
 * ## Field Ownership
 * - **Raw chain state**: address, firstSeenLedger
 * - **Derived**: totalTicketsBought, totalRafflesEntered, totalRafflesWon,
 *   totalPrizeXlm, lastTxHash (idempotency key), updatedAt
 *
 * ## Updater Handlers
 * - `UserProcessor.handleTicketPurchased()`: Increments totalTicketsBought and
 *   totalRafflesEntered (if first ticket in raffle)
 * - `UserProcessor.handleRaffleFinalized()`: Increments totalRafflesWon and totalPrizeXlm
 * - `UserProcessor.handleRaffleCreated()`: Ensures creator has user row
 *
 * ## Recalculation Safety
 * - ✅ Safe: totalTicketsBought = COUNT(tickets WHERE owner = X)
 * - ✅ Safe: totalRafflesEntered = COUNT(DISTINCT raffle_id FROM tickets WHERE owner = X)
 * - ✅ Safe: totalRafflesWon = COUNT(raffles WHERE winner = X)
 * - ✅ Safe: totalPrizeXlm = SUM(prize_amount FROM raffles WHERE winner = X)
 * - ⚠️ Caution: Recalculation resets lastTxHash, breaking idempotency
 *
 * ## Idempotency
 * - `lastTxHash` acts as idempotency key — processors skip if it matches incoming txHash
 *
 * See: `ENTITY_OWNERSHIP.md` for full documentation
