/**
 * Represents a single raffle ticket purchased by a user.
 * Columns map to the `tickets` table in ARCHITECTURE.md.
 *
 * ## Field Ownership
 * - **Raw chain state**: All fields (id, raffleId, owner, purchasedAtLedger,
 *   purchaseTxHash, refunded, refundTxHash)
 * - **Derived**: None
 *
 * ## Updater Handlers
 * - `TicketProcessor.handleTicketPurchased()`: Inserts ticket rows idempotently
 * - `TicketProcessor.handleTicketRefunded()`: Updates refunded flag and refundTxHash
 *
 * ## Recalculation Safety
 * - ❌ Unsafe: All fields are source-of-truth from chain events
 *
 * ## Idempotency
 * - Event-level: TicketProcessor skips when any row already exists for
 *   `purchaseTxHash` (shared across all ticket_ids in one purchase)
 * - Row-level: inserts use orIgnore() on the ticket `id` primary key
 *
 * See: `ENTITY_OWNERSHIP.md` for full documentation
